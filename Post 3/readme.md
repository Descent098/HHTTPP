# Post 3; Implementing the networking portion

We have what we need to make HTTP requests and responses properly, so now let's look at adding networking so we can see the results in the browser. It's important to note we're only covering enough networking to understand **this project**, we're not covering everything there is to know about networking. So keep in mind there might be more steps and technologies in real server interactions!

Also keep in mind for this set of code there is no easy way to test it, and as such there are no additional tests for this post.

## How connections work (TODO)

Previously we looked at a bunch of terms 

- Ip's and ports
  - ipv4 vs ipv6
  - Localhost
- hostname/DNS
- 


## Berkley Sockets (TODO)

\**We will cover the basics, but if you want a breakdown of sockets in detail (in python and in the underlying C calls python is making) check out [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Descent098/783f68e1e3943e8796a3aaf8a14f8013).*
