# Post 4; Creating a CLI

Now that we have our functionality, it's time to make our program more practical and easy to use.

## Why? (TODO)

Creating a CLI is great when you don't want to make people have to run a script all the time. It offers a few benefits:

1. It can be invoked from the command line; There's no need to keep a file in every directory you want to use it in
2. It allows you to pass arguments/flags in an easy manner
3. It allows you to seperate your more common usage into an easy to use CLI, while allowing an API to exist for more complicated functionality or use cases

## Other final touches

- Documenting the CLI and usage
